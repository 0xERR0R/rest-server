Change: Add subrepo support and refactor server code

Support for multi-level repositories has been added, so now each user can have
its own subrepositories. This feature is always enabled.

Authentication for the Prometheus /metrics endpoint can now be disabled with the
new `--prometheus-no-auth` flag.

We have split out all HTTP handling to a separate `repo` subpackage to cleanly
separate the server code from the code that handles a single repository. The new
RepoHandler also makes it easier to reuse rest-server as a Go component in
any other HTTP server.

The refactoring makes the code significantly easier to follow and understand,
which in turn makes it easier to add new features, audit for security and debug
issues.
