Security: Stricter path sanitization

The framework we're using in rest-server to decode paths to repositories
allowed specifying URL-encoded characters in paths, including sensitive
characters such as `/` (encoded as `%2F`).

We've changed this unintended behavior, such that rest-server now rejects
such paths. In particular, it is no longer possible to specify sub-repositories
for users by encoding the path with `%2F`, such as `http://localhost:8000/foo%2Fbar`,
which means that this will unfortunately be a breaking change in that case.

If using sub-repositories for users is important to you, please let us know in
the forum, so we can learn about your use case and implement this properly. As
it currently stands, the ability to use sub-repositories was an unintentional
feature made possible by the URL decoding framework used, and hence never meant
to be supported in the first place. If we wish to have this feature in
rest-server, we'd like to have it implemented properly and intentionally.
